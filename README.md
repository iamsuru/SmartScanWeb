SmartScan 2.0 is an improved version of SmartScan, which is a Smart India Hackathon Project.


This project addresses the problem faced by an individual while uploading files in a website form.


There are many problems that could arise while filling out a form.


The document to be uploaded is present in hard copy and there is no scanner available.


Applications could be used to scan the document from the phone and then have to be shared to the system via some means and then uploaded which is little inconvenient.


Here the application is a prerequisite which everybody might not have in their phone.


If someone is not using their personnel system then it could a privacy concern, as someone might forget to delete the files.


If the user already have the file in soft copy, but is present in their mobile phone they could simply choose to upload the file, without transferring it to the computer.


Before the file is uploaded to the form it is preprocessed and made into a scanned document and gets compressed to a very generous quality and a single PDF file is made.


Through this implementation any person who wants to upload a file in a form can upload without any issue .
